This app acts as a sample fast food menu.
The user builds their complete meal by choosing various options from the different sections of the menu.

It was written entirely programmatically. No storyboards or nibs were used.

Features:
- visual constraints
- Container view with multiple View Controllers alive at one time
- animations to transition from one menu section to the next
